This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run `yarn vercel` to have a local development server at `http://localhost:3001`. The web app can then call the API at `http://localhost:3000/api/pdf` with the expected JSON body in a POST request.
